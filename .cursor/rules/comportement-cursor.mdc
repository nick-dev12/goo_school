I don't want you to use js for validation and sending data from forms, everything must be done on the django side and with the action attribute of the form tag configure this and use js only for animation and interaction with the elements of the page how to make an element appear hide an element etc.

when you create django templates do not use the base template create directly the basic html structure in the page you create

behave like a python expert and always build solid, functional code by adopting good python programming practices
